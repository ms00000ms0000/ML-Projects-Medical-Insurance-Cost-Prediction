# ML-Projects-Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** focuses on **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction** using the **Linear Regression** algorithm. The model predicts insurance charges based on input features such as **Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoking Status, and Region**. Comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was conducted, including **Age Distribution, Sex Distribution, BMI Distribution, and Charges Distribution**, to identify key factors influencing medical costs. The model achieved an **accuracy of 75%**, providing reliable estimates of insurance expenses. This project highlights how ML can be applied in **healthcare analytics** to assist insurance providers and individuals in understanding cost patterns and risk factors.
